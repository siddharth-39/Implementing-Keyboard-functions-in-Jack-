# Implementing-Keyboard-functions-in-Jack- and building Hack Computer

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing keyboard functions in the Jack programming language for the Hack Computer. The Hack Computer is a computer architecture introduced in the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" (also known as "Nand to Tetris").

## Resource reference
https://www.nand2tetris.org/

## Pre-requisites
-Hack Computer Emulator: 

-Basic Programming Skills

-Basic Command Line Knowledge

-Nand2Tetris Course Knowledge (Recommended): 

-String Classes in Jack

-Output Classes in Jack

-Keyboard Classes in Jack

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open your preferred Jack compiler and load the project's Jack files.
3. Compile and load the modified Jack files onto the Hack Computer's CPU emulator.

## Implementation Details
We have added a new Jack class that interacts with the computer's keyboard hardware. This class includes methods for reading individual key presses, detecting key events, and handling keyboard input.

- `Keyboard.jack`: This Jack class handles keyboard interactions. It provides methods to check for key presses, get the ASCII code of the pressed key, and manage key events.

## Usage
1. Load the `Keyboard.jack` file into your Jack compiler.
2. Import the `Keyboard` module into your main Jack program.
3. Use the provided methods from the `Keyboard` class to interact with keyboard input in your programs.
4. Load the hack computer file
